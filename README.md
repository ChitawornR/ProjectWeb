# About my Portfolio
During my second year of study, I created this project to serve as a personal portfolio. In it, I demonstrate the various skills I learned and applied during that time. I did my best to make the portfolio as good as possible. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were all used in various ways throughout the development process of this project.
